# Client

This directory has a sample Dapp to interact with your contracts, built using
React.

## Running the Dapp

This project uses [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/), so most
configuration files are handled by it.

To run it, you just need to execute `yarn start` in a terminal, and open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To learn more about what `create-react-app` offers, you can read
[its documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).
